# Code written for counting Alveoli

During my PhD at the [Institute of Anatomy](http://ana.unibe.ch) of the [University of Bern](http://unibe.ch) I was running a SVN repository server on the [virtual server infrastructure](http://www.id.unibe.ch/content/services/hosting/virtuelle_server/) of the University of Bern.

Since I'm no longer working there I migrated all the code to GitHub, using `git svn clone http://code.ana.unibe.ch/svn/RepositoryName`

This repository here contains code that was used to track alveoli using MATLAB.
